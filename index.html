		<p> At The HopeLine, the Bronx’s first diaper distribution center, Executive Director Maria Cintron said demand has sharply increased. <br> National data show that about half of U.S. households with children aged 4 and under cannot afford enough diapers. </p>

		<p> “The demand alone of just seeing people waiting to make an appointment has doubled,” Cintron said. </p>

		<p> Human Resources Administration data shows the five community districts with the highest share of SNAP users are all in the Bronx. <br> In the district The HopeLine serves, 40% of residents relied on SNAP as of April 2024. </p>

		<p> Though diapers are essential for children’s health, they are excluded from SNAP and WIC. </p>

		<p> Cintron launched The HopeLine’s diaper program in 2015 after families began requesting them alongside food. <br> Today, the organization serves about 800 children a month and distributes roughly 35,000 diapers. </p>
