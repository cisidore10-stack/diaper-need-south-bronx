		<h1>South Bronx resource center combats diaper need </h1>

		<h2>In the South Bronx, the struggle to afford diapers reflects a national trend.</h2>

		<h3>By Charlotte Isidore - December 8, 2025 </h3>


		<p> At The HopeLine, the Bronx’s first diaper distribution center, Executive Director Maria Cintron said <br> demand has sharply increased. <a href="https://nationaldiaperbanknetwork.org/the-ndbn-diaper-check-2024/">National data</a> shows that about half of U.S. households with <br> children aged 4 and under cannot afford enough diapers. </p>

		<p> “The demand alone of just seeing people waiting to make an appointment has doubled,” Cintron said. </p>

		<p>  <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Borough-Community-District-Report/5awp-wfkt/about_data">NYC Human Resources Administration data</a> from Sept. 2025 shows that 5 out of the 10 <br> community districts with the highest number of SNAP recipients are in the Bronx. </p>

		<p> Though diapers are essential for children’s health, <a href="https://nationaldiaperbanknetwork.org/federal-issues/">they are excluded from SNAP and WIC.</a> </p>

		<p> Cintron launched The HopeLine’s diaper program in 2015 after families began requesting them <br> alongside food. Today, the organization <a href="https://thehopeline.org/diaper-need/">serves</a> about 800 children a month and distributes <br> roughly 35,000 diapers. </p>
